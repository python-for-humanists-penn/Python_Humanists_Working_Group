Dictionary Exercise from Chapter 5 of Automate the Boring Stuff...


Create an initial dictionary and store it in birthdays 

1. You can see if the entered name exists as a key in the dictionary with the `in` keyword 
2. If the name is in the dictionary, you access the associated value using square brackets
3. If not, you can add it using the same square bracket syntax combined with the assignment operator
4. When you run this program, it will look like this:

Enter a name: (blank to quit)
Alice
Apr 1 is the birthday of Alice
Enter a name: (blank to quit)
Eve
I do not have birthday information for Eve
What is their birthday?
Dec 5
Birthday database updated.
Enter a name: (blank to quit)
Eve
Dec 5 is the birthday of Eve
Enter a name: (blank to quit)
