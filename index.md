## Welcome to the Python for Humanists Working Group at Penn! We are a group of scholars interested in learning the ways in which the Python programming language is useful to our work. 

We meet on Thursdays from 2-3:30 pm in 616 Williams Hall (Humanities Touchdown Space, Price Lab) for open-ended exploration of the ways in which Python can enhance our academic pursuits. If you are interested in joining, you are welcome to stop by any of our meetings. At the beginning of each month, we will be welcoming newcomers and beginners. We look forward to seeing you there!
