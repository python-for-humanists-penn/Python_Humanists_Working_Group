# # In preparation for next week's session, go through chapter 5 of "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter5/) - take a closer look at "The Get() Method" - and bring any questions you may have to our meeting. We will work with chapter 5 next week (Monday, February 26, 9:30-11:00, 623 Williams Hall). 

# Work on this activity (designed by Sasha) for next week:                                                                                        

# # Activity: Ask user 'How are you?' and if they respond 'great' REGARDLESS OF CASE, return "Awesome!". For everything else, return "I hope your day goes better!". Bonus challenge, return "Awesome!" even if the user enters white space around their answer, such as "   great    ".
