[1] Our roadmap for the coming weeks (as suggested by Scott): Let's work through the following chapters of "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" 
(https://automatetheboringstuff.com/):

(take a look at the chapters at home if you have time)

A. Chapter 1: Everything.

B. Chapter 4: From the beginning to the end of "Removing Values from Lists with `del` Statements."

C. Chapter 5: Just the beginning. Stop just as you reach `birthdays.py`.

D. Chapter 6: From the beginning to the end of "The `in` and `not` in Operators with Strings." 

E. Chapter 3: From the beginning to the end of "The None Value."

F. Chapter 2: Everything.

G. Chapter 3: Everything remaining, starting from "Keyword Arguments and `print()`"

H. Chapter 4: Everything remaining, starting from "Working with Lists"

I. Chapter 5: Everything remaining, starting from "birthdays.py"

J. Chapter 6: Everything remaining, starting from "Useful String Methods"


[2] Scott's notes from this week's session:

Core Python types:
- int (1, 2, 3...)
- float (1.0, 2.2, 3.1415...)
- str ('a', 'cat', 'was') [comma needs to be outside of the 'quotation marks' in Python!]
- list ([1,2], ['x','y','z'])
- dict ({'a':1, 'b':2})

Functions - call or (?) define:

def add (a,b):
  return a+b
result = add (1,2)


For loops + if statements:

For x in range (0,10):
  ...
if x = 3
  ...
